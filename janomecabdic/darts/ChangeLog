	* Bugs in EOS (end of string) handling:
	In previous code, one cannot distingwish string's terminal and
	NULL charactor, since NULL charctor is used as a maker for 
	any string's terminal.	to cope with this problem, 
	I used a special charctor (insted of NULL) to identify the string's terminal. 
	This modification will cause a incompatibility of index structure.
	
	* compress double-array using zlib:
	added an experimental code allows users to (de)compress the doulbe-array
	using zlib.

	* Modifiing the return value of open and save:
	Taking the UNIX-style functions into account,
	the return value of function, open and save are modified.
	0 implies 'successfull' -1 implies 'errro'.

	* new method:
	get_unit_size(), which returns the size of one Unit of Double-Array,
	is added to the class.
